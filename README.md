# Spectral
A cool dynamic library based game engine

## The idea

A game engine that uses dynamic libraries to store compiled scripts, and uses C/C++ for a scripting language.

Also very extensible, down to the most low-level things, for example, an extension can add a custom scripting language that has a custom compile and load functions.
